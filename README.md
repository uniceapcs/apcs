Here is my APCS website. 
<h1>welcome to my travel diary website!</h1>
a bit about me: hello! my name is unice, i am 16 years old and i love to travel. because of my mom's job as a pianist along with my brother and I's musical learnings, we have been lucky enough to travel to many different places because of musical opportunities. i hope you enjoy this mini diary of it! 
<h2>this summer</h2>
europe!! this was one of the best experiences. i have been there before, all for a music program that my mom teaches. we went to the program again this year; it was so nice to reunite with everyone and play music there. 

<strong>i even filmed the experience! here's the video i made on my day-to-day life there: https://youtu.be/ZGMYYbWmnbY </strong> 
<h3>2019</h3>
like we all know, COVID took the world by storm in 2020. so, 2019 was the last time that i did a LOT of travelling which i'm so grateful for!
